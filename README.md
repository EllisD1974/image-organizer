# image-organizer
This is intended to allow for quick organization of images into differently named directories.

This is not intended to be granular organization by using tags.



## TODO ##
 - Add way of renaming images
   - This technically could cover a form of "tagging" in the sense of renaming, appending keywords to make the
        individual images searchable
 - Show total number and current number of images in directory
 - Auto update categories when new folders are added/removed
 - Improve way of selecting categories
   - Maybe make the selection easier, larger, searchable, way to show large number of categories
